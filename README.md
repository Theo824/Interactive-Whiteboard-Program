Programmed two Raspberry Pis to communicate and exchange drawings in real time over UART through a GUI, 
using my own handshake protocol for synchronisation.

The GUI was developed using the cross-platform IDE Qt Creator.

Created two threads: serialise and deserialise, 
with the serialise thread encoding the QT points into bits 
and sending them through its own UART-like communication with my independently made handshake protocol.

I had to compress the video demonstration to keep it under GitHubâ€™s maximum size limit, which explains the reduced quality.
